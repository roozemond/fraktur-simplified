Alternative Christmas song, quite different from the muzak you are exposed to during your shopping experience. The music worked very well with the film: ["Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGs_vGt0MY8).

In the description on youtube it says "Marry Mr Lawrence", an interesting interpretation of that movie.
