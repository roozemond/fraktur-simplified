This summer I went for three weeks on holidays in France. I have been there before, and always went offline. 
I always did bring my laptop, but couldn't find open wifi where we were staying (in the country side). This
 year I also took my [Nokia n82](http://europe.nokia.com/find-products/devices/nokia-n82) and I decided to 
try to get internet on this mobile phone. The best deal I could find was with [Orange](http://www.orange.fr/). 
I bought a Mobicarte online for €15 (right now they are on offer for €7). You just have to search Mobicarte 
on their site. There is a problem: you can order but they only deliver in France. I asked a friend to 
receive the package and send the SIM card to me in a letter, but maybe you don't have a friend in France. 
Then you can try to put your name and vacation address, and choose to pick up your delivery in a [Kiala relais](http://www.kiala.fr). In France they do not like anonymous SIM cards, so later while ordering you have to tell them who you are (name, birthday, address), and these details should probably match the ID you use when picking up your delivery. I think the package is kept for two weeks at the Kiala relais. Suppose this all worked out. Now you have a 3G capable SIM with a €5 balance. Go to a supermarket and buy a Orange recharge for €15. To get internet access: search "Internet Max'' on the [Orange](http://www.orange.fr/) website. It gives you 24/24 internet access for €12 per month, deducted from your balance (now €20). You do not have email access (or it is charged for separately). There is a maximum data transfer of 0.5 GB, but some say it is not strictly enforced. Some words of warning: The validity of the card is short, about 1 month after the top-up. The number is yours for about 6 months, so you may have to repeat this every vacation. To turn on the Internet Max option (and to a lesser extend to do the top-up) you have to go through menus with options in French. If you feel uncomfortable with this you may try an Orange shop, there are quite a few in shopping malls. In the country side you have a big chance that 3G is not there. It worked for me at the beach!
