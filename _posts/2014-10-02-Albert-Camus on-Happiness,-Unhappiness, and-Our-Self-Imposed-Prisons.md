Camus later revisits this osmosis between the physical and the metaphysical 
in a poignant reflection on our self-imposed prisons of unhappiness:

*It is not true that the heart wears out — but the body creates this illusion.*

*Those who prefer their principles over their happiness, they refuse to be 
happy outside the conditions they seem to have attached to their happiness. 
If they are happy by surprise, they find themselves disabled, unhappy to be 
deprived of their unhappiness.*


*“All true happiness, as all that is truly beautiful, can only result from 
order”*, Benjamin Franklin wrote, and yet, as Camus so stirringly reminds us, 
order itself, when worshiped too blindly and rigidly, can consume our fragile 
chance of happiness.
